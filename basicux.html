        <p class="introText">
          The purpose of this module was to learn a selection of UX design and
          research methods, as well as testing, presenting and communicating the
          results. The main project was to be conducted in a group to create a
          concept for an online shop selling T-shirts.

              The first part of the Basic UX theme we were taught about the
              methods of desk research, observation, interview and surveys.

            <p>
              <b>Desk Research:</b> The choice of topic for this theme was
              ethical online stores that are transparent about the proccess in
              which their products are made with a focus on natural dyes.<br /><br />
              <b>Observation:</b> AEIOU model for sorting data while observing a
              selection of friends conducting online shopping.<br /><br />
              <b>Interview:</b> I interviewed friends face to face a number of
              prepared questions along with some more in the moment questions
              while recording audio and taking notes.<br /><br />
              <b>Survey:</b> Which was conducted amongst the entire class from
              which a summary of the key findings were extrapolated for my
              chosen subject.<br /><br />

              The second part of the assignment, where groups were formed and
              preperations were made to decide which idea fits best to move
              forward with.
            </p>
            <h4>Process & Knowledge</h4>
            <p>
              Our first step as a group was to make use of guard rails and
              sharing and voting methods to narrow down our suggestions which
              initially derived from our individual preparations with Crazy 8s
              and Solution Sketches.<br />
              We have decided on what our product will be and what makes our
              product’s “unique selling point”. Card sorting method was the most
              crucial step to our final decision of what to include in our
              webstore as in content and navigation. This step led us to create
              Adobe XD Prototype Click here!our paper prototype. We made 3 paper
              prototype tests and the results showed key findings about the
              placement of our navigation bar, order view page issues and e-mail
              confirmation section in the order form. In the light of these key
              findings, we started preparing the XD prototype to make ready for
              the Think Aloud test. When our XD prototype was ready, we were
              happy with the general results regarding the usability and flow.
              And we are ready to take the next step in our design.

            <h4>Process & Knowledge</h4>
            <p>
              We created our website's content and design after targeting our
              clients. According to our client profile who is well-educated and
              critical, we decided to have a section thatdeclares the company's
              statement.<br /><br />
              Card sorting method was the most crucial step to our final
              decision of what to include in our webstore as in content and
              navigation. This step led us to createour paper prototype. We made
              3 paper prototype tests and the results showed key findings about
              the placement of our navigation bar, order view page issues and
              e-mail confirmation section in the order form.<br /><br />
              Our paper prototype test showed that our product view page was
              lacking unity. The testers showed us that there wasn't enough
              clear distinctions between selection elements such as size, color
              and amount and the visuals.<br /><br />
              Think aloud test showed us that our drop-down menu was not big
              enough to be differentiated from the navigation bar.
