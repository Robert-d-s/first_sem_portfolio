          In this module we were taught the fundamentals of how to plan, shoot
          and edit video footage. This is also where we had our first real-life
          client collaboration for which we had to create a new or improved
          online brand identity.

            Plan, shoot, and edit a 1-minute video that tells a story without
            using words, neither verbal nor written.

          <p>
            This assignment served as an introduction to the fundamentals of
            video editing. With the help of my flatmate, I planned and shot a
            simple video in my home. The intent of the subject matter is a
            familiar case that we have all experienced at some point or more
            likely multiple times in our lives when we misplace something,
            turning our house upside down in the pursuit of finding it, only to
            find out it was right in front of us the entire time.

            This was our main task that need to be accomplished for this theme
            and as a request from the client.
          </p>
          <h4>Process & Knowledge</h4>
          <p>
            The assignment started off with a client debrief in front of the
            whole class in which we learned that the company (BeerWalks) owner
            (Christoffer) wished to widen his brand awareness around his already
            established concept and possibly expand into other concepts in the
            future so that it may reach a broader target audience.<br /><br />
            <b>Treatment:</b> Presenting the entire story of our intended video
            idea in the present tense, making sure the theme of the idea is well
            understood. <b>Storyboard:</b> We drew up panels relating to the
            story and relevant information, such as camera movements and angles,
            sounds and locations, dramaturgical elements, and narrative
            curves.<br /><br />
            All the footage used in the video ad was shot at one of the
            Beerwalks after making sure we had the approval of everyone
            attending, with further footage of ourselves going around the same
            walk path as the walk itself usually takes.
