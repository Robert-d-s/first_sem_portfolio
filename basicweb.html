          This module served as a basic but intensive introduction to some of
          the foundational tools of the Multimedia profession. Basic website
          building using markup (HTML) and stylesheet (CSS) languages, centered
          around design principles by the use of image processing (Photoshop),
          vector drawing (Illustrator) and prototyping (XD), spanning over 3
          seperate projects.

              <i>02.01.01 Individual assignment</i><br />
              First assignment of the Basic Web theme. A text description and
              thematic images were provided with the purpose of creating a
              mobile-first semantically marked up webpage, with good
              readability, contrast and color pallete, and should follow at
              least some Gestault Laws.
            </p>
            <h4>Process & Knowledge</h4>
            <p>
              I started off by creating a five-color palette as the basis of the
              webpage from one of the images provided that was most appealing to
              me personally.I incorporated some principals of Gestault Laws and
              contrasts to the best of my understanding at the time, and chose
              some fonts that best fit the text description and art style of the
              theme while keeping in mind the importance of readability.
              <br />
              Correct semantic tags were applied wherever it was deemed
              necessary.

              Second assignment of the Basic Web theme. Building on top of the
              knowledge gained from the previous assignment, a website
              consisting of several pages was required with a grid-based layout
              based on wireframes for a desktop view.
            </p>
            <h4>Process & Knowledge</h4>
            <p>
              Similar to the previous assignment, the main text to be used was
              provided while the choice of accompanying imagery was entirely up
              to us. I based my color palette and layout off of an image of an
              old microcomputer magazine that fit well with the theme
              description and text. An additional page describing our personal
              experience of first encountering a computer, along with an
              easy-to-use global navigation, was also necessary.

              The third and final assignment of the basic web theme. As the
              title implies, this is a website based on a personal interest. A
              choice between 3 distinct design styles was given, with an
              additional requirement that the site be responsive.
            </p>
            <h4>Process & Knowledge</h4>
            <p>
              Of the provided design styles, I ended up with the style: organic,
              as this best fit the interest I chose. coffee. It was not my first
              choice, as in this assignment I found myself overthinking my
              choices and changing my mind often, but half way through I managed
              to settle for the adapted style. Creating and updating a moodboard
              aided in solidifying my decisions. Here I also opted for CSS
              grid-areas, which helped create a more dynamic loading grid
              centered around the contents rather than absolute positioning.Here
              is also where the first types of user testing and media queries
              were introduced that enable a website to be responsive.
